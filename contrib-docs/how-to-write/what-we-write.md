In this article, you'll find information about whether or not a given topic and/or type of content should be included on MDN.

> **Note:** Be aware that all contributions to MDN fall under specific open source licenses; these are [described in detail](/en-US/docs/MDN/About#copyrights_and_licenses) on our [About MDN](/en-US/docs/MDN/About) page. Keep in mind that Mozilla's [Websites & Communications Terms of Use](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/legal/terms/mozilla/) are in effect when you use or contribute to MDN. <!--- links need to be revisited--->

## Topics that belong on MDN

In general, if it's an open web-facing technology, we document it on MDN. This includes any feature that can be used by web developers creating websites and applications, now and in the near future. If a feature is implemented by multiple browsers and either accepted as standard or is progressing towards standardization, then yes, we definitely document it here. If a feature is still very experimental and not implemented in multiple browsers and/or liable to change, then it is still suitable for inclusion, but may not be seen as a priority for the writer's team to work on.

Our primary focus is to write about the following front-end web technologies:

- [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)
- [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)
- [JavaScript](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
- [SVG](/en-US/docs/Web/SVG)
- [Web APIs](/en-US/docs/Web/API)
- [WebGL](/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API)
- etc.

And so, you too can contribute towards these topic areas.

> **Note:** Back-end technologies usually have their own documentation elsewhere that MDN does not attempt to supersede, although we [do have some exceptions](/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side).

We also welcome topics that cut across technologies but are relevant to web development, such as:

- [Accessibility](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility)
- [AJAX](/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/AJAX)
- [Web graphics](/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/Graphics)
- [Progressive web apps](/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps)
- [Web-based games](/en-US/docs/Games)

> **Note:** MDN covers some non-standard features if they're exposed to the web, especially if they find common usage; for example, we have documentation for WebKit-specific CSS properties. MDN also covers some non-web standards technologies if they are considered useful enough to web developers (see our [Web-related technologies](/en-US/docs/Related) section).

## Topics that don't belong on MDN

In general, anything that isn't an open web standard does not belong on MDN.

Examples of inappropriate topics for MDN include:

- Technology that is not exposed to the web and is specific to a non-Mozilla browser.
- Technology that is not related to the web or Mozilla products.
- Documentation for end-users. For Mozilla products, for example, such documentation belongs on the [Mozilla support site](https://support.mozilla.org).

## Types of documents that belong on MDN

In general, MDN is for _product_ documentation, not for _project_ or _process_ documentation (except [about MDN itself](/en-US/docs/MDN)). So, if the document is about "how to use a thing" or "how a thing works" (where, the "thing" is in one of the topic categories mentioned above), then it can go on MDN. But if it is about "who's working on developing a thing" or "plans for developing a thing", then it shouldn't go on MDN. In that case, if the thing is being developed under the umbrella of Mozilla, then the [Mozilla project wiki](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Main_Page) may be a good place for it.

Here are some examples of types of documents that should _not_ be placed on MDN:

- Planning documents
- Design documents
- Project proposals
- Specifications or standards
- Promotional material, advertising, or [personal information](#about_your_profile)

## Editorial policies that govern the content on MDN

This section describes the policies set by the Mozilla MDN staff to govern the content on MDN. All contributors are expected to abide by these policies.

### Relevance

All content on MDN must be relevant to the technology section in which it appears. Spam (commercial advertisement) and other irrelevant content will never be accepted onto the site. Contributors who keep trying to submit spam may be banned from MDN at the discretion of Mozilla MDN staff.

<!--- Outbound links to commercial sites that are relevant to the topic from which they are linked will be judged on a case-by-case basis. Their value in aiding web developers must outweigh the commercial benefit to the linked site. [need to add link to External Links guidelines]--->

### Neutrality

Article content on MDN must maintain a [neutral point-of-view](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view), reporting on browser variations without editorial bias. Derogatory comments about any browser or user agent are not acceptable.

MDN contains _browser-neutral_ documentation that enables web developers to write _browser-agnostic_ code.

Web technologies to be documented on MDN should be on a standard track and be implemented by at least one rendering engine. Variations in browser support are documented in the [browser compatibility](/en-US/docs/MDN/Structures/Compatibility_tables) section of an article.

### Structure

Reference pages should follow the same structure as other pages of the same type. See [Page Types](/en-US/docs/MDN/Structures/Page_types) for a list and examples of common page structures. <!--- needs to be revisited--->

### Guidelines

Contributors are expected to follow the [MDN guidelines](/en-US/docs/MDN/Guidelines) for writing style, code samples, and other topics. <!--- needs to be revisited--->
