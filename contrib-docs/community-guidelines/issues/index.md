## Working on an issue

All repositories have an issue tracker, where you can find tasks to help contribute

Most repositories have a `help-wanted` label or `good-first-issue` label. Some do not, but this is not a pre-requisite and you are welcome to browse and pick something that is suitable for your skill set.

Once you've found an issue you'd like to work on, amke sure no one else is assigned to the issue. Add a comment saying you would like to work on it and assign the issue to yourself.

Most issues need some investigation before work can start, if you need to ask questions

_(define)_

If you take on an issue we expect work to happen in a timely manner. If you can no longer take on the task, leave a comment and unassign yourself.

Fork and branch the repository, do your work and open a [pull request](linktopullrequest).
