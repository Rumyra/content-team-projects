# Getting Started

MDN Web Docs needs your help. This page outlines what you can do to help.

> **Note:** If you haven't contributed to MDN previously, the [Getting Started](general/index.md) guide explains the process in four simple steps. Good news, you're already on step 2: "Picking a task to complete."!

## What can I do to help?

There are multiple avenues you can take to contribute to MDN depending on your skillset and interests. Along with each task we provide a short description and an approximate time that each type of task typically takes.

If you are not sure what to do, you are always welcome to [ask for help](general/index.md#step_4_ask_for_help).

## Primary contribution types

The links in this section lead to detailed guides explaining how to do a particular contribution task that we are most interested in getting community help with, either because they are a critical function, and/or because they have a large backlog associated with them. Please consider helping out with these tasks before you consider contributing in other ways.

### Fixing content bugs

Our [content repo](https://github.com/mdn/content/) is where people [submit issues](https://github.com/mdn/content/issues) to report problems found with MDN docs. We get a lot of content bugs, and any help you can give in fixing them would be much appreciated.

#### Skillset required

- Basic knowledge of using [Git and GitHub](../getting-started/git-github-beginners/index.md).
- Knowledge of the web technologies you choose to help with (e.g JavaScript, CSS).
- A reasonable understanding of the English language (don’t worry if your English is not perfect; we can help you with it).

### Reviewing content pull requests

People submit pull requests on our content repo all the time to update MDN content, and we need help reviewing them. Read our pull request review guide to find out how the reviewing process works, and how you can get involved.

#### Skillset required

## Repositories

The documentation you read on MDN Web Docs is made up of an array of sources all of which can be found on GitHub.

- [MDN Core](../repositories/core-repositories/index.md)
- [Code examples and demos](../repositories/code-examples-demos/index.md)

## How MDN works

Intro to content, yari, kuma, bcd, interactive examples etc...

The best way to get started is by finding an issue to fix on one of our repositories

# Getting started with MDN Web Docs

We are an open community of developers building resources for a better Web, regardless of brand, browser, or platform. Anyone can contribute, and each person who does contribute makes us stronger. Together we can continue to drive innovation on the Web to serve the greater good. It starts here, with you.

Every part of MDN (docs, demos, and the site itself) is created by an open community of developers. Please, join us!

## 4 simple steps to MDN

MDN is an open source resource where **anyone** can add and edit content. You don't need to be a programmer or know a lot about technologies. There are plenty of things that need to be done, from proofreading and correcting typos to writing API documentation.

Contributing is easy and safe. Even if you make a mistake, it's easily fixed. Even if you don't know exactly how things should look, or your grammar isn't all that good, don't worry about it! We have a team of people whose job it is to make sure that MDN's contents are as good as possible. Someone will be along to make sure your work is tidy and well-written. Share what you know and follow your strengths.

### Step 1: Create a GitHub account

To begin your contributions to MDN, you need to [create a GitHub account](https://github.com/mdn/content/#setup).

### Step 2: Pick a task to complete

Now that you are logged in, read the descriptions of the different task types available on the [main Contribute page](../../index.md#ways-to-contribute), and decide which one most appeals to you. You can pick any task you like and begin your contribution.

### Step 3: Do the task

Once you've decided what kind of task you want to do, find a specific page, code example, etc. to work on, and just do it!

### Step 4: Ask for help

If you are not sure what to do at any point, then you are more than [welcome to ask for help](../../index.md#get-in-touch). Don’t worry about doing it perfectly; other MDN Web Docs contributors are here to help fix errors that slip through.

## Useful beginner's guides

We expect contributors to MDN to have a certain amount of prerequisite knowledge
before they start contributing to the content. If you are new to the following
topics, we'd advise you to look at the provided links to help you get up to
speed:

- Web technologies: If you are new to HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc., check out our [Learn web development](/en-US/docs/Learn) tutorials.
- Open source: If you've never contributed to an open source project before, have a read of [Basic etiquette for open source projects](/en-US/docs/MDN/Contribute/Open_source_etiquette).
- Git and GitHub: If you are unfamiliar with these tools, [GitHub for complete beginners](/en-US/docs/MDN/Contribute/GitHub_beginners) will get you started.
- MDN's repo structures: If you are not sure what repos to edit to make changes to the different parts of MDN's content, [Where is everything on MDN?](/en-US/docs/MDN/Contribute/Where_is_everything) will point you towards the correct places.
