## Make progress, not noise

Think carefully about the way you handle communication in the project — make sure it is useful, and that it doesn’t make other contributors jobs harder. Submitting pull requests to fix issues is great, but are they truly useful, and easy to review? Filing issues and joining in other conversations is fine, but are your issues and comments on topic, or are they just adding noise?

As a rule, do:

- Fix one issue per PR — it may be slightly more work for you, but it is much easier to review a single clear fix.
- Ask questions using other mechanisms like [chat rooms](https://chat.mozilla.org/#/room/#mdn:mozilla.org) or [forums](<(https://discourse.mozilla.org/c/mdn/236)>) if you are not sure whether something is useful or have a simple question.
- Read the [contributor documentation]() and [how to write documentation]() first to try to answer the question yourself before filing a pr.

Don’t:

- Try to cram multiple fixes into a single pull request. It makes it a lot harder to review, and raises suspicions (some people might think you are trying to hide some malicious code in between the valid changes).
